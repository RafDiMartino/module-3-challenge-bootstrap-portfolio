# Bootstrap Portfolio Page - challenge

## Description
In this assignement my task was to create a Personal Portfolio Webpage using Bootstrap, the project includes: 

- Bootsrtap Navigation
- Bootstrap Jumbotron
- Bootstrap Grid
- Bootstrap Cards

With this Bootstrap solution I have also managed responsive layouts without the use of CSS media queries and used as many bootstrap classes as I could.
